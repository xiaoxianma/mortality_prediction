# Mortality Prediction
This repo implements all three methodologies that the paper ["Improving Clinical Outcome Predictions Using Convolution over Medical Entities with Multimodal Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12349) proposed. The three models are basic RNN model, RNN model with averaged medical entities, and RNN model with CNN model on medical entities.

# Steps to run
1. Follow `pipeline/README.md` to prepare data.
2. Follow `models/README.md` to train models.
3. Check results under `models/<model>/results`.
